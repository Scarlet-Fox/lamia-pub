* Async - asyncronous code is a chef in a busy kitchen. Network activities will run at once. Requires some special science in the form of promises and callbacks. Works great when activities are mainly driven by network or filesystem operations. Small and quick ones.
* [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) - a web framework created by [Tom Christie](http://www.tomchristie.com/). It's asyncronous and relatively [lightweight and fast](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=db&l=zijw8v-1).
