Project Philosophy
==================

General
-------

* Open source communities should be safe spaces where software is discussed without hate.
* Code should begin simple and add complexity and abstraction only as needed to address identifiable problems.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a good idea, it should be generally followed, except where there is a good reason for an exception.
* Do not assume negative intentions or malevolence when it is possible that a simple misunderstanding occurred instead.
* Listening is more important than explaining.

Contributions
-------------

* Forks are great.
* Pull requests are awesome, but they may not always be accepted. In these cases, it is acceptable to fork.
