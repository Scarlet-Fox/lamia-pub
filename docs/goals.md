* allow people to register accounts
* allow accounts to map to more than one identity
* allow accounts to map to more than one blog
* let folks post polls (this should be "fun")
* let folks post blog posts
* let folks post statuses
* provide customizable profiles
* provide an accessible experience
* be fast, lightweight, and full asyncronous
* have relatively minimal dependencies
* have source code that is readable and makes some manner of sense
* have a friendly community with positive vibes
* have an attractive base theme that is Cool
* have a clean, thoughtful user experience

What lamia will not do is...
