# Contributing to Lamia

This document contains all of the important information for contributing to Lamia! Lamia is still a work in progress at this time, but by reading this you can learn how to best help in making lamia even better.

## Ways to Help

### Bug reports

Bug reports are one of the most useful resources that non-technical users can assist in improving lamia. After all, Bugs cannot be fixed if they arn't known.

For bug reports, we already offer a default issue template for bug reports, it will walk you through the important information that you can provide to assist us in solving the issue. The more information you can provide the better!

### Feature Requests

If you think that there is a feature that Lamia needs and is lacking in, you can write up a feature request in order to inform us. 

Like bug reports, we also provide a default issue template for feature requests which will walk you through the important information that you should provide to give the best chance of your feature being implemented.

### Code Contributions

Code contributions are the bulk of this document, as they can be the hardest to nail down the proper do's and don'ts.

If you want to contribute code, go ahead and look for anywhere in our issues that is tagged `Needs Implementation` and see if you can take a crack at it! We try to make sure that any implementation requests are clear cut and easy to understand. 

The most important steps to take are to first fork the repository. Pull it down to work on, and once you think your code is ready, make a pull request and someone will look it over to make sure it's ready to be added to the main codebase. Once its confirmed and ready to be merged, we will merge it and you can close your local branch. 

If we don't think the code is quite ready to be added to master, don't get discouraged! That just means that there are some improvements you can make first. Whoever checked your code will give some tips on what to improve, either in terms of style, documentation, or otherwise. All of the information on style and structure of our code is listed below.

### Documentation Contributions

We do not at this time have a formalized guideline to documentation, maybe you can help contribute to that as well! Documentation contributions can either be commenting the code with good method and class docstrings, or describing and organizing the information about how to use lamia.
